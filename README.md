# CZDS Client
This package interacts with the CZDS API, to download zonefiles. It can be used programatically or directly using the cli.js script.
## Documentation
You can generate the documentation using `npm run docs`.
## CLI
To use the CLI you need to complete the credentials.json file (following the credentials.json.example), and then run:
```
node cli.js [directory]
```

If directory is not specified, zones/ is used.
